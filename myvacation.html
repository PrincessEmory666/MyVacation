        For my vaciion I went to San franscio. I had never been to california and I had an amazing time. I love the wearther and all the wondewrful things about the town. they have some of the most beautiful art in the city as well as unique local owned shops. I got to see the golden bridge in person and I got my picture taken in front of it.
